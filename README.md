# Amplitude-Modulation-and-Demodulation-using-NumPy-and-Matplotlib
## AIM

To implement and analyze amplitude modulation (AM) using Python's NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. Apparatus Required
Software: Python with NumPy and Matplotlib libraries

## HARDWARE
Personal Computer

## THEORY

Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a technique used in electronic communication, primarily for transmitting information via a radio carrier wave. In AM, the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to that of the message signal. The general form of an AM signal is:<img width="290" height="152" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbe771a4-4857-47ca-a3e3-c9e0559add09" />


## ALGORITHM

1.	Initialize Parameters: Set the values for carrier frequency, message frequency, and sampling frequency.
2.	Generate Time Axis: Create a time vector for the signal duration.
3.	Generate Message Signal: Define the message signal as a cosine wave.
4.	Generate Carrier Signal: Define the carrier signal as a cosine wave.
5.	Modulate Signal: Apply the AM formula to obtain the modulated signal.
6.	Plot the Signals: Use Matplotlib to plot the message signal, carrier signal, and modulated signal.
